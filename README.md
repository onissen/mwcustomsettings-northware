# mwcustomsettings-northware

This Repository contains some Customization-Settings and Custom Functions to give my [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) the right instructions to suite Northware's Fits.

All contents of this repository are included in the index.php of this repository. 
This File it self can be imported to the `LocalSettings.php` of MediaWiki to implement all the stuff needed:

````php
include 'mwcustomsettings-northware/index.php'; // Copy this Code to the buttom of your LocalSettings.php if this Repository is located at the Root-Directory of your MediaWiki-Instance.
````

The Custom Template to the Vecor-Skin is located in [vector-northware](https://github.com/onissen/vector-northware).
